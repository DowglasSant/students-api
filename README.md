### Students API Description

This API was created to put into practice the concepts of MapStruct, a Java library for converting entities into DTOs. Basically, it's a system that registers and lists students. The API will check that basic information is present, check that the CPF format provided at the time of registration is valid. And only then, if the information provided is valid, will the application register the student in the database.
